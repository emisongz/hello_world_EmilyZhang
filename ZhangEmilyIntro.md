Hi! My name is Emily Zhang. I am currently a senior at NYU Stern studying Business with a Concentration in Econometrics and Quantitative Economics while minoring in Data Science. I have worked with Python, Java, R, and SQL in the past. Some tools or libraries that I have used across these coding languages include pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, statsmodels, seaborn, matplotlib, plotly, and tidyverse.

At the Summer Institute of Biostatistics and Data Science at Columbia University, I conducted my first public health research project under the advisement of Professor Jeanette Stingone, contributing to a cross-sectional epidemiologic study on environmental exposures and gestational diabetes risk. I led data cleaning and preprocessing in R, constructing an analytic dataset from over twenty years of national survey data (NHANES) and assessing exposure-outcome relationships using Spearman’s rank correlation and logistic regression. Our analysis identified strong correlations among certain phthalate metabolites and fasting glucose levels approximately 20 mg/dL higher in the gestational diabetes group compared to the non-GDM group. This experience was deeply rewarding, as it showed me how rigorous data analysis can clarify complex public health questions and solidified my commitment to working at the intersection of data, inequality, and policy to address structural health disparities.
